I'm a Software Engineer based in Melbourne, Australia.

I've received a degree in Software Engineering from Monash University in 2008, before code bootcamp and online courses where a thing.
I've had varied roles as a 'full-stack' web developer, software engineer and plain 'engineer' during cloud, devops, platform activities.

I'm going to try to write about my past experiences, stories and thoughts. As well as chronicle my current thinking about todays world of software engineer practices and career path.

These thoughts and writings won't be sandbagged, they'll be possibly be wrong! But writing any other way, writing too safe and with a feeling that it is all correct just feels wrong.
